# Net Practice

This project is a general practice exercise to let you discover networking.

"Here we go again". This is what I have in mind when I know that I have to do this project. Why? Because I have to relearn how to everything about networks because I already "give back" all the knowledge to my lecturer.Â ðŸ¤¡

To prevent this from happening again, I decided to write this README.md to help me remember how to configure networks.Â ðŸ¤“

## Basics of Networking

### Networks

In the context of computing, a network refers to a **collection of interconnected devices**, such as computers, servers, printers, and other devices, that are **linked together to facilitate communication and the sharing of resources**. These devices **can be physically connected by cables or wirelessly connected** through technologies like WI-FI.

The primary purpose of a network is to enable communication and data transfer between devices. By connecting devices in a network, users can:

1. Share information
2. Access shared resources
3. Collaborate on projects (using software like Google Docs, Email, etc.)
4. Communivate with each other (using software like Skype, Zoom, etc.)

Network can be categorized based on its size. They can be as small as a local network in a home or office, connecting a few devices, or as large as a global network, like the internet, which interconnects billions of devices worldwide. Network can be classified into three types based on their scale:

1. **Local Area Network (LAN)**
   
   A type of network that spans a relatively small geographical area, such as home, office building, or campus. It connects devices within a few hundred meters to a few kilometers. LANs are commonly used for sharing files, printers, and internet access among devices in a local environemnt. Ethernet is a common technology used in LANs. LANs usually owned and managed by an individual or organization.

   > Ethernet is a technology that allows devices like computers, printers, and routers to connect and communicate with each other wihin a small area, like an office or home. It uses a special cables to send and receive data between devices.

2. **Wide Area Network (WAN)**

  A WAN is a network that covers a large geographical area, like multiple cities, countries or even continents. WANs connect multiple LANs and other networks, enabling communication and data transfer over long distance. Internet is the largest WAN in the world. They typically rely on leased lines, satellite links to establish connectivity accross vast distances.

3. **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**

  This type of network covers a larger geographical area than a LAN but smaller than a WAN. It typically spans a city or a town, connecting multiple LANs like WANs. They are commonly employed by service providers or institutions to provide internet connectivity to a large number of users.

### Importance of networks

1. Communication and Collaboration. They enable sharing of information, resources, and services, making collaboration and communication much easier.
2. Resource sharing. Allow devices to share resources such as printer, scnanners and storage devices, without needing each devices to have separate resources. This will helps reduce to cost savings and efficiency.
3. Data transfer. They allow the information can be accessed and shared from anywhere wihtin the network, allowing for easy retriveval of files, databases, and etc.
4. Internet access. Allsow users to access the internet, access to vast amount of information, connects to people, organization worldwide.

> There are many more importance of networks. But i'm just going to list a few here.

### OSI Model and TCP/TP Protocol

OSI model is a conceptual framework that defines the functions and interactions of various network protocols and technologies. It consists of sever layers:

1. Physical layer
2. Data link layer
3. Network layer
4. Transport layer
5. Session layer
6. Presentation layer
7. Application layer

This model provides a structured approach to understanding and organizing network communcation, ensuring compatibility between different systems. It servers as a reference for designing, implementing, and troubleshooting network protocols and systems.
